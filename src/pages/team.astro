        bio: 'Lazer is the CEO of Concrete Media which he founded in 2014. Originally from Brooklyn, New York, his entry into PR is worthy of a feature story of its own. He co-founded a PR firm in New York in 2009 before moving with his wife to Israel and starting Concrete. He believes a good PR pro is a reporter’s best asset and his decade-long relationships with some of the top tech reporters attest to that belief. Lazer and his wife have four children — who are much more interested in their mom’s floral design business than whatever it is their dad does on the computer.',

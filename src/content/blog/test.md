**_Is my announcement newsworthy or for the newswire?_**

We divide press releases into one of two categories: 'Newsworthy' and 'Newswire'. 

**Newsworthy Definition** 

A newsworthy press release will have real news value.

On the most basic level, that means that it is of interest and importance to the public and not just to the company making the announcement and their existing customers. The audience might be niche - i.e. developers or DevOps professionals - or it might appeal to a wider audience. 

The significance of the news and the breadth of audiences it pertains to will determine how much coverage that release gets. 

**Newswire Definition**

A newswire story is one that doesn't reach the threshold of media interest but is still valuable to publish on the newswire so that it will show up in search and in order to '_Beat the Corporate Drumbeat_' by showing that the company is growing and notching wins. Newswire stories aren't pitched to the media and there is no expectation that they will get media coverage beyond the newswire publication.  

**Categorizing release types:** 

Assessing the value of an announcement is almost always on a case-by-case basis. A PR professional will ask pertinent questions to understand the news value of a given event and then set expectations on the category and expected coverage. 

Having said that, we will put forth some general rules for stories that are (1) usually newsworthy, (2) those that should be placed on the newswire only, and (3) stories that fall into the gray area and could go either way based on the specifics. 

**Newsworthy Announcements** 

Surveys and reports - A customer survey or an exclusive report based on user behavior is almost always of interest to journalists. PR professionals should be brought into the process early on, before the survey questions are formulated or the report is compiled, to ensure that there's a good media hook. 

Funding - A funding round is one of the most significant opportunities to get media interest in a company. 

Acquisitions - A company acquiring another company or being acquired. 

Vulnerabilities - Disclosures of vulnerabilities, hacks, leaks, etc. are the most sought-after stories by cyber journalists. If they impact a major brand or sensitive targets like hospitals or infrastructure, they are of especially great interest. 

**Not newsworthy (Newswire)** 

Hire - Unless the hire was a top executive at a major company or has a significant media profile. 

Awards - The exception is that Israeli media will sometimes report on Israeli companies winning major international awards 

Company milestone - The company reaches a milestone number of clients, for example. An exception might be announcing a **very** significant ARR along with a valuation or a giant number of users. 

Rebranding/renaming/new messaging - Instead, we incorporate the new name and messaging into future news stories. 

Conference attendance—Simply attending a conference or sponsoring one isn't newsworthy in itself. If the company is displaying technology for the first time, we can assess the level of significance on a case-by-case basis. 

**Gray area** 

Product/feature release/update - this is the broadest category, and _a product release story can range from a mainstream news event to a newswire release_. 

Here are some of the factors that will determine what type of announcement it is: 

**New:** The word 'news' comes from 'new' so the first question we'll ask is if there is a ‘**first’** in this release. Can we legitimately say that this product is the first to do X or Y?

**Impact:** If the feature or update will make it somewhat easier or cheaper for developers to do their job, it will be of limited to no interest. Likewise, if it only impacts existing clients, it would not reach the threshold of being newsworthy. Conversely, if it fundamentally changes the way the user goes about their work, it could be newsworthy  

**Simplicity:** The complexity of the technology will also determine if it is newsworthy and how newsworthy it is. Reporters must be able to understand the technology and be able to communicate it to their readers on their level. 

**Timely:** As with all stories, if it's related to a topic that is currently getting major news coverage, it will boost its newsworthiness. If you're announcing an integration with a buzzy technology, even if it's common, that could be of genuine interest. 

**Use case:** If we can tell an interesting story about how this will impact users, it could be newsworthy. If the product impacts entire companies (beyond saving them a bit of money or time) or even an industry, it can be of great media interest. 

New Customer—The client's brand recognition and the uniqueness of the use case have the biggest impact on its newsworthiness. The company must be a household name to be newsworthy. Often, the press release itself won’t garner coverage, but the availability of a customer for an interview is a strong offer to a reporter.  

Certifications - Standard certifications like SOC 2, which are awarded to thousands of companies, aren’t newsworthy. More rigorous certifications like an FDA approval or a rare/first certification by a recognized body can be newsworthy.   

Partnership - Joining a standard partner program with hundreds of thousands of member companies isn’t newsworthy. A genuine technological partnership with a universally known tech company on the other hand can be very newsworthy. 

_Please note that if the story has a timely aspect, it can significantly elevate the story. By timely, we mean that it connects to a hot topic or trend—e.g., GenAI—rather than being connected to the attendance of a conference._
